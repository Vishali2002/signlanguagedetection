Sign Language Detection Project
This project focuses on developing a real-time sign language recognition system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide a tool that can interpret hand gestures into meaningful sign language words to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing and speech impairments.

Key Features:
Hand Gesture Recognition: Utilized OpenCV for image processing to detect and segment hand gestures from live video feeds or pre-recorded inputs.
Machine Learning Model: Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Python and TensorFlow/Keras to classify different hand gestures representing sign language symbols.
Real-Time Detection: Achieved real-time performance with high accuracy by processing live video input, allowing immediate translation of gestures into text.
Data Preprocessing: Applied image augmentation techniques and preprocessed gesture images to enhance model accuracy and generalization.
User Interface: Developed a simple GUI for real-time gesture display and translation output.
Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
Future Enhancements:
Expand the gesture vocabulary to cover more complex phrases.
Integrate speech synthesis for audio output of recognized gestures.
Improve model performance and accuracy by using larger datasets.
