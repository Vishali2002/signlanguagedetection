Sign Language Detection Project
This project focuses on creating a real-time system for recognizing and interpreting hand gestures into sign language using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist individuals with hearing and speech impairments by translating their hand gestures into meaningful text.

Features
Hand Gesture Detection: Utilizes OpenCV for detecting and segmenting hand gestures from video input (live or recorded).
Machine Learning Model: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand gestures corresponding to different sign language symbols.
Real-Time Translation: Capable of processing video feeds in real time, providing immediate translation of hand gestures to text.
Data Preprocessing: Includes image augmentation and preprocessing techniques to improve model accuracy and performance.
User Interface: Features a simple and interactive GUI for real-time display of gesture recognition and text translation.
Technologies Used
Languages: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
Future Enhancements
Extend the vocabulary to recognize more complex sign language phrases.
Integrate speech synthesis to convert recognized gestures into audio.
Improve model accuracy using larger datasets and more robust architectures.
